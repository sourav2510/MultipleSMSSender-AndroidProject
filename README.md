# MultipleSMSSender

This app can be used to broadcast text messages.
It could be a tiring job to send messages to multiple recipients at once. 
As the name suggests this is an app which helps in sending SMS or message in multiple ways. 
We can send a message to multiple contacts and multiple times at once. 
This feature can be helpful in many circumstances as for example sending new year wishes to multiple contacts simultaneously. 
Also, there is a feature of sending messages to WhatsApp via. which we can send messages to multiple contacts. 
Lastly there is a feature of send each word which splits the message string into words and then each word can be sent 
separately in each line.
